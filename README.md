# prototyping_eurorack

Prototyping pcb and panel for eurorack format.

## develop environment

- KiCad v5.1.4

- 4ms kicad library.

https://github.com/4ms/4ms-kicad-lib

## Current Status

Now manufacturing prototype. So please wait to use this.

## Panel (4HP, 8HP, 10HP)

fr4 2-layer panel layout is based on Delptronics Module Construction Kit.

2-layer is more cost effective against original panel.

Added some hole for connecting pcb by soldering horizontal header.

## PCB (100mm x 50mm)

Universal use prototyping board features x6 DIP-8 op amp (TL072 etc) layout.

## Caution

Some footprint is missing on this repository.

They are based on KiCad library and modified to remove silkscreen.
